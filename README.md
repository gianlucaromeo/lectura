# Why this repo?
I liked the concept of Clean Architecture when I first heard of it. However, sometimes it seems over complicated and unnecessary. Furthermore, many developers stated that Riverpod should not be the state management to use in an app structured with a Clean Architecture.
<br><br>I think this is true, but I wanted to test it myself. Today, I can state that I am having troubles in integrating both Riverpod and Clean Architecture due to the way Riverpod works.
<br><br>My next step is to change Riverpod with a new State Management and see what happens.
<br><br>P.S.: In the past, I used GetX, and it worked quite well.
